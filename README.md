# Real-Time-Face-Detection-using-OpenCV-
This project demonstrates real-time face detection using a webcam and OpenCV in Python. It uses the Haar Cascade Classifier to detect human faces and draws a green rectangle around each detected face in live video.

#Features
Real-time face detection from webcam
Uses OpenCV Haar Cascade (haarcascade_frontalface_default.xml)
Draws bounding boxes around detected faces
Press Q to quit the application
Lightweight and fast

#Technologies Used
Python
OpenCV (cv2)
Haar Cascade Classifier
Webcam (live video capture)

#How It Works
Loads the Haar cascade face detection model
Captures live video from the webcam
Detects faces frame by frame
Draws rectangles around faces
Displays the output in real time
